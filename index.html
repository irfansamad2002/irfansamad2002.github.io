            <p>Traditionally, tea is made by steeping Camellia sinensis leaves in hot water. According to legend,
                tea was discovered in 2737 BCE by the Chinese sage/emperor Shennong.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>In the world, black tea makes up over 75% of the total amount produced, green tea makes up 20%,
                and oolongs, whites, and yellow tea make up the remainder. Teas like rooibos tea,
                mate, rose hip tea and chamomile tea have also become popular among global tea lovers.
                These infusions contain no Camellia sinensis leaves, so they aren't tea.</p>

            <p>It is rich in xenobiotics, which are secondary metabolites. Tea plants contain these metabolites as a
                natural defense system,
                but when consumed, they are metabolized alongside water-soluble compounds. Hence its inclusion in health
                and wellness discussions.</p>

            <p>Tea is as deep as it is vast. Because of it, wars have been fought. A lot of us turn to it at certain
                times of the day.
                Welcome to a journey in tea. We choose tea for many reasons. Have a great time sipping!</p>
