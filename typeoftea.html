            <h2>What Is Tea? What About Tisanes?</h2>
            <p>The Camellia sinensis tea plant is the source of all teas. The six different types of tea are based on
                how
                the tea leaves are processed rather than the sort of plant that produced them:</p>

            <p>What about other "Teas" like chamomile, yerba mate, and rooibos? They undoubtedly appear to be from
                several
                plants.</p>

            <p>They do come from distinct plants, after all. However, they aren't actually "tea," but rather tisanes, a
                French word for a herbal infusion.</p>

            <p>That's all there is to the distinction between tea and tisane. In fact, the term "tea" is restricted by
                law
                to only refer to tea derived from the Camellia sinensis plant in Europe and many other nations.</p>

            <p>Let's discover how the six various forms of tea differ from one another now that the concept of tea has
                been
                made clear.</p>

            <h2>Six Type Of Teas From Camellia Sinensis</h2>
            <p>Given that all teas are made from the same plant, the way growers and manufacturers prepare the tea
                leaves
                determines the various varieties.
                Different ways of processing result in various degrees of oxidation and fermenta tion, and thus, various
                types of tea.</p>

            <p>This means that if the producers have the expertise and talent to do so, one tea garden, no matter where
                it
                is situated in the world, can produce all six types of tea.</p>

            <p>So let's examine the many processing techniques that affect the various flavor profiles of tea along with
                a
                few illustrations of each type of tea.</p>

            <h2>White Tea</h2>
            <p>The least processed tea is white tea. Although certain white teas undergo an additional drying phase at
                low temperatures, the majority of white teas are simply picked and withered (both indoors and outdoors)
                for days.</p>
            <div class="smallBox">
                <p>White Teas named as follow</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Silver Needle: purely buds</li>
                    <li>White Peony: one bud and one or two leaves</li>
                    <li>Tribute Eyebrow (Gong Mei): buds and leaves</li>
                    <li>Longevity Eyebrow (Shou Mei): mature leaves from later in the season</li>

        <div class="Green Tea bigOlText box" id="GreenTeaJump">
            <h2>Green Tea</h2>
            <p>Green tea is an exceedingly famous preference among each informal and extra enthusiastic tea drinkers
                withinside the United States, possibly because of severa media stores touting its fitness benefits.</p>
            <p>As green tea is heated after a quick withering step to save you oxidation, it includes high levels of
                antioxidants, polyphenols, and chlorophyll.</p>
            <p>Afterward, the leaves are rolled or pressed to develop the flavor.</p>

            <div class="smallBox">
                <p>Different regions have their tradition of shaping their tea, and the names of the green teas reflect
                    the
                    shape. A few examples are</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taiping Monkey King (Taiping Houkui): leaves rolled among cord meshes to create flat leaves</li>
                    <li>Dragon Well (Long Jing): buds pressed into flat needles</li>
                    <li>Green Snail Spring (Bi Lo Chun): leaves rolled between the palms</li>

        <!-- Yellow Tea -->
        <div class="YellowTea bigOlText box" id="YellowTeaJump">
            <h2>Yellow Tea</h2>
            <p>While much less common than different teas, the producing manner used to develop yellow tea is noticeably
                just like the steps taken for green tea.</p>
            <p>In addition to most of the processing steps used to make green tea, yellow tea undergoes wrapping
                (additionally known as heaping or yellowing), which reasons non-enzymatic oxidation (previously thought
                of as microbial fermentation).</p>
            <p>This wrapping step brings out extra mellow taste in tea and much less astringent and vegetal notes
                associated with green tea.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- oolong Tea -->
        <div class="OolongTea bigOlText box" id="OolongTeaJump">
            <h2>Oolong Tea</h2>
            <p>Oolong tea is regularly referred to as the partly oxidized tea, sitting among green tea and black tea in
                terms of oxidation.</p>
            <p>Oolong tea is regularly referred to as the partly oxidized tea, sitting among green tea and black tea in
                terms of oxidation.</p>
            <p>This is also why oolong is much darker in colour than green tea. More oxidation means darker in colour.
                This is also why oolong teas higher in oxidation are darker in colour than the ones lower in oxidation.
            </p>
            <div class="smallBox">
                <p>Oolong tea is generally categorised by its oxidation and roasting degrees as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bao Zhong: 10-18% oxidized</li>
                    <li>Bao Zhong: 10-18% oxidized</li>
                    <li>Dark Oolongs: 40-60%+ oxidized</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Some Oolongs, inclusive of Baked Oolongs, also are roasted on the cease for an extra layer of flavor,
                such as fruity, floral, or toasty notes.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Black Tea -->
        <div class="BlackTea bigOlText box" id="BlackTeaJump">
            <h2>Black Tea</h2>
            <p>Black tea is the maximum consumed tea throughout the world; in the U.S., 86% of the tea loved at some
                stage in 2017 was black tea.</p>
            <p>Unlike partially oxidized oolong tea, black tea is absolutely oxidized after an extended length of
                withering. Tea leaves are rolled or cut to expedite the oxidation process.</p>
            <p>Because black tea is completely oxidized, it does not undergo a separate heating stage to prevent the
                oxidation and it is going straight to the drying step.</p>
            <p>Also, the oxidation process reduces the bitterness and increase the sweetness in tea.</p>
            <div class="smallBox">
                <p>A few examples of black teas are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assam Black: malty black tea from Assam, India</li>
                    <li>Darjeeling Black: more delicate black tea from Darjeeling, India</li>
                    <li>Keemun Black: sweet and fruity black tea from Anhui, China</li>
                    <li> Lapsang Souchong: smoky black tea from Fujian, China</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- dark tea -->
        <div class="DarkTea bigOlText box" id="DarkTeaJump">
            <h2>Dark Tea</h2>
            <p>Many count on that "darkish" tea and "black" tea are the same, however there may be a world of difference
                separating these categories.</p>
            <p>Darks teas are really closer to green teas in that they are processed much like green teas in the
                beginning. Then, they go through a microbial fermentation process and are aged for years to come.</p>
            <div class="smallBox">
                <p>A few examples of darkish teas may be categorized based on their location and type of processing the
                    tea
                    leaves go through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raw Pu-erh: Naturally fermented tea from Yunnan Province, China</li>
                    <li>Ripe Pu-erh: Fully fermented tea from Yunnan Province, China</li>
                    <li>Golden Flower Brick Tea (Jin Hua Fu Cha): Fully fermented tea from Hunan Province, China</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Fermentation is sometimes stopped after just a few months, however many teas benefit from years and years
                of microbial activity.</p>
